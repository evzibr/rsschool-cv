## About myself

Back in 2012 I got a scholarship and moved to Germany from Russia for my Master's Studies (in English). After obtaining a degree in Communication and Media Engineering I started working as a picture editor. In 2016 I changed to Content Management and switched to Graphic Design in 2020. 

Being keen on learning more about HTML and CSS, I did a lot of self-study and was able to start working as a Frontend Developer with focus on CSS in the beginning of 2022. Currently I work remotely as a Frontend Developer with focus on SCSS in one of the Web-Agencies in Germany. In order to continue growing in the area of Web-Development, I have decided to learn JavaScript and at least one of its frameworks.
