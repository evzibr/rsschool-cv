## About myself
Back in 2012 I have moved to Germany from Russia for my Master's Studies (in English) and started working as a picture editor after its successful completion.
In 2016 I started working as a Content Manager and switched to Graphic Design in 2020. 

Being keen on learning more about HTML and CSS, I have taken some courses on Udemy and was able to start working as a Frontend Developer with focus on SCSS in the beginning of 2022. Currently I work remotely in one of the Web-Agencies in Germany and in order to continue growing in the area of Frontend Development, I have decided to join RS School and learn JavaScript.
